**For the how-to info, see:** https://github.com/Schnitzel725/4523-TA_Scripts/blob/master/MQ_Scripts/README.md

### Note: `MQ_to_Excel.py` is not 100% error-proof. 
   * The human using this script should still check the output, then copy in the `LO`'s and information about the LO's at the top rows
   * This is not made to get things done in a few seconds. You (the TA) will still need to read the slides/textbook/etc. to make the quiz questions.
   ** This script will only speed up the time it takes to convert the questions you made 
   in a `.txt` file (assuming using UTF-8, not ANSI encoding) to the `.xlsx` format that Blackboard uses for the MQ's. 

##### Requirements
   * A computer that can run `Python 3` or later. 
   * Having `Tkinter`. (It should come pre-installed)
