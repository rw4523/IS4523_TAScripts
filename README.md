# IS4523-TAScripts
Scripts for increasing/improving efficiency for TA-related tasks for IS4523

### Who can use these scripts?
The IS4523 TA/Professor(s) because these scripts are specific to the course. 
If you're not the IS4523 TA/Professor(s), please run away screaming.

### Who do I blame if I'm not the TA/Professor(s) and I try to run the scripts and it crashes?
Its time for you to look inward, and start asking yourself the big questions.

### Where are the instructions for using the scripts?
You can find the instructions **[HERE](https://github.com/rw4523/IS4523_TAScripts/blob/master/MQ_Scripts/README.md)**.

### Other notes:
* If you are the TA/Professor(s) and you run into an issue/need help troubleshooting, please send me an email (my email is in slide 68-ish in the "READ ME FIRST" powerpoint) or a message on discord (email for details).
