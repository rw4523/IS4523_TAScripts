# IS4523-TAScripts
Scripts for increasing/improving efficiency for TA-related tasks for IS4523

### Who can use these scripts?
The IS4523 TA/Professor(s) because these scripts are specific to the course. 
If you're not the IS4523 TA/Professor(s), how did you get here?

### Who do I blame if I'm not the TA/Professor(s) and I try to run the scripts and it crashes?
Not me.

### Other notes:
* This repository was copied over from my other github account. I moved it into this one so that in case I change my name on that one, the link from the "Read me first".pptx won't break.
* If you are the TA/Professor(s) and you run into an issue/need help troubleshooting, please send me an email (my email is in ~slide 68-ish in the "READ ME FIRST" powerpoint) or a message on discord (email for details).
